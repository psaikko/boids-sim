# boids-sim

Plain javascript simulation of a [boids](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/37402.37406) model.

Models swarming (flocking) behavior of bird-like objects by emergent behavior from simple rules:

- collision avoidance: avoid nearby boids
- velocity matching: move in a similar direction to nearby boids
- flock centering: stay close to nearby boids
